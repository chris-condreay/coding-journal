### 4.1 If-else Branches

#### Branch Basics(If)

A ***branch*** is a sequence of statements only executed under a certain condition

An ***if*** branch is a branch taken only IF an expression is true

#### If-else Branches
An ***if-else*** branch has two branches: The first is executed IF an expression is true, ELSE the other branch is executed

#### If-else if-else branches

Commonly a programmer wishes to take one of multiple (3 or more) branches. An if-else statement can be extended to an if-elseif-else structure

In some cases, order doesn't matter as long as one branch can have a true expression

### 4.2 Detecting equal calues with branches

#### Detecting if two items are equal using an if statement

An ***if statement*** executes a group of statements if an expression is true
  - Braces surround the if statements

***Braces*** {}, sometimes redundantly called curly braces, represent a grouping, such as a grouping of statements

The ***equality operator (==)*** evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal

#### Equality and inequality operators

The ***inequality operator (!=)*** evaluates to true if the left and right sides are not equal, or different

- An expression involving the equality or inequality operators evaluates to a Boolean value

A ***Boolean*** is a type that has just two values: true or false

#### If-else statement

An ***if-else statement*** executes one group of statements when an expression is true, and another group of statements when the expression is false
